This is a very raw implentation of conways game of life in ruby. 

This depends on `chunky_png` and `ffmpeg`. You can install chunky via `gem
install chunky_png` and `ffmpeg` can be installed through most package managers
on `-x` systems

This could be made much more efficient in many ways including rewriting it in
something that isnt Ruby ðŸ˜… Also `chunky_png` could be replaced with something
like OilyPNG to speed things up. 

Additionally the actual specifications for the game of life should utilize an
infinited sized board. This limits the board to the size specified and so cells
outside the edges of the seed array are considered 'dead' but can not be
brought to life. 

### Usage:

```
Usage: ./conway.rb -i SAMPLE_SEED.json -g 25 -s 12 -t test-run -a
    -t, --title TITLE                Title of Directory
    -s, --scale SCALE                Scale of pixels in output images
    -g, --generations GENERATIONS    How many generations to run aka how many frames to generate.
    -x, --x_scale X                  Size of width of gameboard
    -y, --y_scale Y                  Size of height of gameboard
    -c, --chance CHANCE              Set probability that 1 in CHANCE will be alive in a random seed
    -a, --animate                    Generate an animated mp4
    -i, --import IMPORT_FILE.json    Provide a seed board as a JSON file. This should be a two dimensional array where every sub array is the same length. Use 0 for dead and 1 for alive. Eg: [[0,1],[1,0]]
```

### run and animate using a JSON seed file @ 25 generations:

```
./conway.rb -i seeds/pulsar.json -g 25 -s 12 -t pulsar -a
```

### run a 5000x5000 random simulation @ 3 generations with no animation:

```
./conway.rb -x 500 -y 500 -g 3 -t 500x500 
```
